<h3 id ="t3">Job description</h3>
<p id="p1">The job of a medical radio technologist is to operate medical machinery meant to take images of the human anatomy. They are healthcare professionals. They use many radiological imaging techniques, such as X-ray, CT scanning, fluoroscopy, interventional radiography, mammography and operating room studies. The images they produce are used to diagnose, treat and monitor patients.</p>

<h3 id ="t4">Basic educationnal requirements:</h3>

<h3 id ="t5">High school courses required</h3>


<p id="left">The high school courses that have to be taken to become a radiology technician heavily depend on the interviewer, however it is stated by ontariocolleges.ca that senior science and math credits will be required, preferably chemistry, biology, and physics. Computer science is also recommended.</p>


<ul id="right">
    <li>Must complete a two to three year college or hospital program in diagnostic radiography or magnetic resonance imaging.</li>
    <li>Must have licensure with a medical body.</li>
    <li>Must have membership with a provincial association (Not in Ontario)</li>
    <li>Must have certification by the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologies</li>
    <li>For Ontario only, registration with the College of Medical Radiation Technologists of Ontario is required</li>
</ul>

            <th>Being an effective communicator is required in order to be a medical radiation technologist. This is because a radiation technologist will have to be able to communicate the findings of their radiation imaging effectively to doctors, and any miscommunication could potentially lead to disastrous consequences, such as the death of a patient or a misdiagnosis.</th>

            <th>Medical skills are very important in order to be a radiation technologist. This is because radiation technologists will have to be able to understand what they are looking at when they see inside of the human body using imaging technology. Otherwise, they could misdiagnose a patient’s illness.</th>

            <th>Must be technologically capable</th>
            <th>All medical radiation specialists need to be technologically capable, because they must operate very complex machines in order to get images of the inside of a patient’s body. Otherwise, they might have difficulty operating the machines they need to in order to do their job..</th>
